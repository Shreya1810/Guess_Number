# Guess_Number
I have created this project after learning basic functions and random module in python.
This project takes user input then compares it with the generated random number.
If the user input is same as random number then user is right and hence come out of loop.
Otherwise, user will have to guess the number till it matches with the random number and user can also see the number of attempts he/she have tried while guessing the right answer.

Thanks for reading
