# Splitting the String and Counting 
In this small project, I have copied any random lyrics from Google.
After that I have created an empty dictionary which helped me to keep track of count of each words used in the lyrics.
The key of the dictionary is th eword while value represents the count of that word in the entire string.

Thanks for reading
